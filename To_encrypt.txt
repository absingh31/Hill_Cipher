''IT WILL BE NO USE TO US, IF TWENTY SUCH SHOULD COME, SINCE YOU WILL NOTZ
VISIT THEM.''Z
Z
''DEPEND UPON IT, MY DEAR, THAT WHEN THERE ARE TWENTY, I WILL VISIT THEMZ
ALL.''Z
Z
MR. BENNET WAS SO ODD A MIXTURE OF QUICK PARTS, SARCASTIC HUMOUR,Z
RESERVE, AND CAPRICE, THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THREEZANDZTWENTY YEARS HADZ
BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIS WIFE UNDERSTAND HIS CHARACTER.  HER  MINDZ
WAS LESS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP. SHE WAS A WOMAN OF MEAN UNDERSTANDING,Z
LITTLE INFORMATION, AND UNCERTAIN TEMPER. WHEN SHE WAS DISCONTENTED,Z
SHE FANCIED HERSELF NERVOUS. THE BUSINESS OF HER LIFE WAS TO GET HERZ
DAUGHTERS MARRIED; ITS SOLACE WAS VISITING AND NEWS.Z

CHAPTER 2Z
Z
MR. BENNET WAS AMONG THE EARLIEST OF THOSE WHO WAITED ON MR. BINGLEY. HEZ
HAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO VISIT HIM, THOUGH TO THE LAST ALWAYS ASSURINGZ
HIS WIFE THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO; AND TILL THE EVENING AFTER THE VISIT WASZ
PAID SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT. IT WAS THEN DISCLOSED IN THE FOLLOWINGZ
MANNER. OBSERVING HIS SECOND DAUGHTER EMPLOYED IN TRIMMING A HAT, HEZ
SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER WITH:Z
Z
''I HOPE MR. BINGLEY WILL LIKE IT, LIZZY.''Z
Z
''WE ARE NOT IN A WAY TO KNOW  WHAT  MR. BINGLEY LIKES,'' SAID HER MOTHERZ
RESENTFULLY, ''SINCE WE ARE NOT TO VISIT.''Z
Z
''BUT YOU FORGET, MAMMA,'' SAID ELIZABETH, ''THAT WE SHALL MEET HIM AT THEZ
ASSEMBLIES, AND THAT MRS. LONG PROMISED TO INTRODUCE HIM.''Z
Z
''I DO NOT BELIEVE MRS. LONG WILL DO ANY SUCH THING. SHE HAS TWO NIECESZ
OF HER OWN. SHE IS A SELFISH, HYPOCRITICAL WOMAN, AND I HAVE NO OPINIONZ
OF HER.''Z
Z
''NO MORE HAVE I,'' SAID MR. BENNET; ''AND I AM GLAD TO FIND THAT YOU DOZ
NOT DEPEND ON HER SERVING YOU.''Z
Z
MRS. BENNET DEIGNED NOT TO MAKE ANY REPLY, BUT, UNABLE TO CONTAINZ
HERSELF, BEGAN SCOLDING ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS.Z
Z
''DONZZZT KEEP COUGHING SO, KITTY, FOR HEAVENZZZS SAKE! HAVE A LITTLEZ
COMPASSION ON MY NERVES. YOU TEAR THEM TO PIECES.''Z
Z
''KITTY HAS NO DISCRETION IN HER COUGHS,'' SAID HER FATHER; ''SHE TIMESZ
THEM ILL.''Z
Z
''I DO NOT COUGH FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT,'' REPLIED KITTY FRETFULLY. ''WHEN ISZ
YOUR NEXT BALL TO BE, LIZZY?''Z
Z
''TOZMORROW FORTNIGHT.''Z
Z
''AYE, SO IT IS,'' CRIED HER MOTHER, ''AND MRS. LONG DOES NOT COME BACKZ
TILL THE DAY BEFORE; SO IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO INTRODUCE HIM,Z
FOR SHE WILL NOT KNOW HIM HERSELF.''Z
Z
''THEN, MY DEAR, YOU MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR FRIEND, AND INTRODUCEZ
MR. BINGLEY TO  HER .''Z
Z
''IMPOSSIBLE, MR. BENNET, IMPOSSIBLE, WHEN I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH HIMZ
MYSELF; HOW CAN YOU BE SO TEASING?''Z
Z
''I HONOUR YOUR CIRCUMSPECTION. A FORTNIGHTZZZS ACQUAINTANCE IS CERTAINLYZ
VERY LITTLE. ONE CANNOT KNOW WHAT A MAN REALLY IS BY THE END OF AZ
FORTNIGHT. BUT IF  WE  DO NOT VENTURE SOMEBODY ELSE WILL; AND AFTER ALL,Z
MRS. LONG AND HER NEICES MUST STAND THEIR CHANCE; AND, THEREFORE, ASZ
SHE WILL THINK IT AN ACT OF KINDNESS, IF YOU DECLINE THE OFFICE, I WILLZ
TAKE IT ON MYSELF.''Z
Z
THE GIRLS STARED AT THEIR FATHER. MRS. BENNET SAID ONLY, ''NONSENSE,Z
NONSENSE!''Z
Z
''WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THAT EMPHATIC EXCLAMATION?'' CRIED HE. ''DOZ
YOU CONSIDER THE FORMS OF INTRODUCTION, AND THE STRESS THAT IS LAID ONZ
THEM, AS NONSENSE? I CANNOT QUITE AGREE WITH YOU  THERE . WHAT SAY YOU,Z
MARY? FOR YOU ARE A YOUNG LADY OF DEEP REFLECTION, I KNOW, AND READZ
GREAT BOOKS AND MAKE EXTRACTS.''Z
Z
MARY WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING SENSIBLE, BUT KNEW NOT HOW.Z
Z
''WHILE MARY IS ADJUSTING HER IDEAS,'' HE CONTINUED, ''LET US RETURN TO MR.Z
BINGLEY.''Z
Z
''I AM SICK OF MR. BINGLEY,'' CRIED HIS WIFE.Z
Z
''I AM SORRY TO HEAR  THAT ; BUT WHY DID NOT YOU TELL ME THAT BEFORE? IFZ
I HAD KNOWN AS MUCH THIS MORNING I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE CALLEDZ
ON HIM. IT IS VERY UNLUCKY; BUT AS I HAVE ACTUALLY PAID THE VISIT, WEZ
CANNOT ESCAPE THE ACQUAINTANCE NOW.''Z
Z
THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE LADIES WAS JUST WHAT HE WISHED; THAT OF MRS.Z
BENNET PERHAPS SURPASSING THE REST; THOUGH, WHEN THE FIRST TUMULT OF JOYZ
WAS OVER, SHE BEGAN TO DECLARE THAT IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED ALL THEZ
WHILE.Z
Z
''HOW GOOD IT WAS IN YOU, MY DEAR MR. BENNET! BUT I KNEW I SHOULDZ
PERSUADE YOU AT LAST. I WAS SURE YOU LOVED YOUR GIRLS TOO WELL TOZ
NEGLECT SUCH AN ACQUAINTANCE. WELL, HOW PLEASED I AM! AND IT IS SUCH AZ
